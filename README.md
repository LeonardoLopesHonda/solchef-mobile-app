# SolChef Mobile App

The SolChef Mobile App works alongside the SolChef solar oven, capturing real-time data from sensors embedded in the device. It provides a clean and user-friendly interface to visualize temperature, performance, and other measurements. The app also stores data in AWS and allows exporting records in CSV format, enabling further analysis and tracking of cooking sessions.

This repository contains the mobile application for SolChef, focused on data presentation, storage, and accessibility.
